            <h2>Recovering data from External Hard Drives </h2>
     
            <p>External Hard Drives are a cost-effective way of increasing your storage capacity.
            They also provide a convenient way of transporting a large amount of data. This portability
            unfortunately means that they can easily get damaged. Whilst they are often well protected
            in an external case, the hard disk drive inside is still vulnerable to impact damage and other trauma,
            especially if the device is powered on when an incident occurs. It is quite common that the hard drive is making a clicking noise.  </p>

                  <h2>How much does an external hard drive data recovery service cost?</h2>
                  <p>Unfortunately, sometimes an external hard drive may be damaged or simply stop working. It is possible to recover data from a hard drive,
                     but it can be time-consuming and difficult. The average hard drive data recovery service cost is £475.</p>

        <h2>Recovering data from SSD (Solid State Drives)</h2>

      <p>SSD or Solid State Drives, have no moving mechanical components and are therefore much less prone to failure than
        traditional spinning disk hard drives. Electronic faults do still occur with
        these devices and of course files do get accidentally deleted or corrupted.   </p>
            <h2>Reasons for data recovery  </h2>
          <p>SSD's like hard disk drives can develop bad sectors and there can be difficulty reading or writing data.
             Electronic faults where the device is not recognised, files become unreadable or corrupted can also occur.  </p>

                        <h2> Recovering data from Desktop PCs & iMacs </h2>
                    
                      <p>Desktop PC's and iMacs are less prone to physical damage than laptops and external hard drives,
                        unfortunately things do still go wrong. The hard drive itself is protected by the computer's casing,
                        but other factors can still lead to data loss. Attempting to recover the data yourself
                        using third party data recovery software may mean the data becomes permanently lost.
                         Even removing the hard drive from the computer may lead to damage of the electronic components.</p>
